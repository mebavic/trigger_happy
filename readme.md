## Project Scope
This project has name 'trigger happy' and it's goal is to create one page web application with a bunch of buttons.
When clicking on a button, it pushes the event into a dataLayer object.

Purpose is to test our template in GTM. So I want to have some playground where I can easily test events such as page view, add to cart, purchase, etc.

Check the 'SEM - Inzerenti – final.xlsx - Eventy.csv' file to see the list of events I want to have a button for, with an example of DL push.
